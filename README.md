# university_projects
A repository of coding and other files I have created during my time of study, associated with different projects I have completed.
-----
The majority of coding for many data activites and projects was carried out using R. 
-----
Most projects have self-explanatory titles.

The two major projects are:

The Effect of Social Structure on Homosexual Activity in Rhesus' Macaques (undergraduate dissertation)
- This code is found in the file "macaque_project_code.R"

How Distance to Range Edge affects Mammal Sensitivity to Deforestation (Master's Thesis)
- This code is yet to be put together, it will be available from August 2021
